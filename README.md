# Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium &amp; Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit

## Inroduction
This project automates the collection of bus travel data from the Redbus website using Selenium, storing it in a structured SQL database. The goal is to develop an interactive Streamlit application that allows users to filter and analyze this data efficiently. By leveraging web scraping techniques and dynamic filtering capabilities, this project aims to provide valuable insights and tools for enhancing operational efficiency and strategic planning in the transportation industry.

## Technology Stack Used &amp; Dependencies to install 
1. Python 
2. Selenium : pip install selenium
3. Streamlit : pip install streamlit
4. SQLAlchemy : pip install sqlalchemy

## Approach
1. Data Scraping:
- Use Selenium to automate the extraction of data from the Redbus website, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability.
  
2. Data Storage:
- Store the scraped data temporarily in Pandas DataFrames.
- Migrate the data to a structured SQL database using SQLAlchemy.
  
3. Streamlit Application:
- Develop an interactive Streamlit application to display and filter the scraped data.
- Implement various filters such as bus type, route, price range, star rating, and seat availability.

4. Data Analysis and Filtering:
- Use SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs.
- Utilize the capabilities of Streamlit to allow users to interact with and visualize the filtered data.
  
5. Results and Insights:
- Ensure successful scraping of data for at least 10 Government State Bus Transport and private bus routes.
- Provide valuable insights into bus travel patterns, pricing strategies, and seat availability.
- Enhance user experience by offering customized travel options based on data insights.
